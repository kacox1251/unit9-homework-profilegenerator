# unit9-homework-profilegenerator

## Description

This is an app that dynamically generates a PDF profile from your Github username!


## Installation

In order to install this project follow the Github link to https://github.com/kacox1251/unit11-homework-notetaker and fork the project. After that clone the repository through your Git Bash. To do that type 'git clone" and paste the HTML link inside your terminal, it will ask you for your github password. After the repository is saved in the directory of your choice you can access the HTML and CSS files and view them in your default browser.
You can also download as a zip file by clicking "Download zip" in the "Clone or Download" dropdown.


## Usage

On your terminal, run 'node app.js' to start. You will see a question appear that will ask you for your github username. Then a follow up question will ask you for your favorite color. After those questions are answered, a PDF file will automatically generate and you now have your profile generated with your Github information and a color scheme that matches your favorite color.
